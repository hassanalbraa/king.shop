    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the KING STORE application's requirements, focusing on user authentication, offer management, and administrative functionalities. Authorization Independence is achieved by storing user roles in a dedicated collection (`/roles_admin/{uid}`) and by using path-based ownership for user-specific data (transactions under `/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}`). This avoids the need for `get()` calls in security rules. Segregation is maintained by separating admin role assignments from user data and game offer data. The addition of a flat `/transactions/{transactionId}` collection simplifies admin auditing, allowing admins to list all transactions with a single, efficient query, rather than a collection group query. This approach supports the required QAPs by ensuring secure `list` operations within each collection, as the security rules can be tailored to the specific data and access patterns of each collection.\n\nThe `/users/{userId}` collection stores user profiles. User-specific transactions are located under `/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}`. Game offers are stored in the `/game_offers/{gameOfferId}` collection. Admin roles are managed in the `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection.\n\nThis structure ensures that authorization checks are straightforward and efficient, promoting scalability and maintainability. The use of descriptive path names and a consistent naming convention enhances debuggability."
